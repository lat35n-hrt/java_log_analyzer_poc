## ⚙️ Planned Features
- Parse Java-style log files (`INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR` entries)
- Extract key events and summarize by timestamp
- Detect repeated error patterns
- Output concise summary reports

## 🚧 Status
Development in progress.
Initial commit created on [date].
Code updates planned over the weekend (e.g., parser.py and sample logs).

## 🧠 Tools
- Python 3.11+
- Regular expressions
- (Optional) Pandas for structured analysis

## 💡 Context
Created as part of ongoing learning for L2 technical support and QA automation roles (Rakuten Travel use case).
